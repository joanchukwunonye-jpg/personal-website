		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p class="aboutme-section-description">
			I am on a personal journey of faith, rooted in a growing desire to understand all
			that God has prepared for me as His child. From a young age, I found myself drawn
			to questions of purpose, identity, and meaning questions that ultimately led me 
			to the study of God’s Word.
			Through Scripture, I continue to discover guidance, clarity, and direction for life.
			The Word has become a foundation for growth, shaping how I think, live, and respond 
			to the world around me. This space is a reflection of that ongoing journey a place to
			explore faith, share insights, and grow in understanding through the truth of God’s Word.
			I believe that with faith, consistency, and divine guidance, we can grow into the fullness
			of who God has called us to be, live with intention, and walk confidently in purpose. 
			This platform is an invitation to learn, reflect, and grow together, grounded in faith and guided by God’s Word.
